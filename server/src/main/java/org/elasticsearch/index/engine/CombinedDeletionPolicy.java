    /**
     * Keeping existing unsafe commits when opening an engine can be problematic because these commits are not safe
     * at the recovering time but they can suddenly become safe in the future.
     * The following issues can happen if unsafe commits are kept oninit.
     * <p>
     * 1. Replica can use unsafe commit in peer-recovery. This happens when a replica with a safe commit c1(max_seqno=1)
     * and an unsafe commit c2(max_seqno=2) recovers from a primary with c1(max_seqno=1). If a new document(seqno=2)
     * is added without flushing, the global checkpoint is advanced to 2; and the replica recovers again, it will use
     * the unsafe commit c2(max_seqno=2 at most gcp=2) as the starting commit for sequenced-based recovery even the
     * commit c2 contains a stale operation and the document(with seqno=2) will not be replicated to the replica.
     * <p>
     * 2. Min translog gen for recovery can go backwards in peer-recovery. This happens when are replica with a safe commit
     * c1(local_checkpoint=1, recovery_translog_gen=1) and an unsafe commit c2(local_checkpoint=2, recovery_translog_gen=2).
     * The replica recovers from a primary, and keeps c2 as the last commit, then sets last_translog_gen to 2. Flushing a new
     * commit on the replica will cause exception as the new last commit c3 will have recovery_translog_gen=1. The recovery
     * translog generation of a commit is calculated based on the current local checkpoint. The local checkpoint of c3 is 1
     * while the local checkpoint of c2 is 2.
     * <p>
     * 3. Commit without translog can be used in recovery. An old index, which was created before multiple-commits is introduced
     * (v6.2), may not have a safe commit. If that index has a snapshotted commit without translog and an unsafe commit,
     * the policy can consider the snapshotted commit as a safe commit for recovery even the commit does not have translog.
